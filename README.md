# Next.js Dashboard with OpenAI-powered Charts

This project is a Next.js application that demonstrates the use of parallel routes and dynamic chart generation using OpenAI's API. It features a dashboard with two charts: a line chart and a bar chart, both populated with data generated by OpenAI.

## Features

-   Next.js 13 App Router
-   Parallel Routes for efficient loading of dashboard components
-   Integration with OpenAI API for dynamic chart data generation
-   Responsive design using Bootstrap
-   TypeScript for type safety
-   React Charts for data visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version 14 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

4. Run the development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    or

    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

-   `app/`: Contains the main application code
    -   `dashboard/`: Dashboard page and components
        -   `@lineChart/`: Parallel route for the line chart
        -   `@barChart/`: Parallel route for the bar chart
    -   `api/`: API routes
        -   `chartData/`: Endpoint for fetching chart data from OpenAI
-   `styles/`: Custom SCSS styles

## How It Works

1. The dashboard page (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) serves as the main entry point.
2. Parallel routes (`@lineChart` and `@barChart`) allow for independent loading of chart components.
3. Each chart component fetches data from the `/api/chartData` endpoint.
4. The API route uses OpenAI to generate random chart data based on the requested chart type.
5. React Charts library is used to render the charts with the fetched data.

## Customization

You can customize the charts by modifying the `LineChart.tsx` and `BarChart.tsx` components. To change the data generation logic, update the prompt in `app/api/chartData/route.ts`.
